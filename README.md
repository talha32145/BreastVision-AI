 🩺 BreastVision AI  

> Early breast cancer detection made accessible, reliable, and AI-powered.  
> Built with Machine Learning, Streamlit, and Generative AI to predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant** with 97% accuracy.  

 Inspiration  
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide. Early detection is key to saving lives, and technology can play a vital role in making screening more accessible. 

 What it does  
Chatbot Mode – Patients or doctors can enter 30 diagnostic features step by step.  
X-ray Analysis – Upload mammogram images and get AI-based benign/malignant predictions.  
Evaluation Dashboard – View accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix & classification report.  

 How we built it  
Python for data preprocessing & ML model development.  
Scikit-learn (LinearSVC) for breast cancer classification.  
Pandas & NumPy for dataset handling.  
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations.  
Streamlit for interactive user interface.  
Google Gemini AI for X-ray image analysis.  

  Challenges we ran into  
Handling 30 feature inputs in a user-friendly way.  
 Integrating image-based AI analysis with structured ML predictions.  
Balancing model accuracy with interpretability.  

 Accomplishments that we’re proud of  
Achieved 97.64% accuracy with LinearSVC.  
Built an interactive Streamlit app combining structured data & image inputs.  
Delivered an accessible, explainable AI tool for healthcare.

 What we learned  
 The importance of user experience (UX) in healthcare AI tools.  
 How to combine ML models with Generative AI for multi-modal predictions.  
 The challenges of balancing accuracy, speed, and usability.  

 What's next for BreastVision AI  
Deploy on the cloud (Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces).  
Enhance X-ray classification with CNNs or transfer learning.  
Add multilingual chatbot support for accessibility.  
Collaborate with healthcare professionals for validation.
